# mouse-wheel
Arduino based exercise wheel counter for a (real, live, furry mammal) mouse

## Overview
We want to see how much exercise our mouse is doing so want to count the number of revolutions on his mouse wheel.  We don't care which way the wheel is turning or how fast. In principle this is quite a simple revolution counter.
